# Stock-Sentiment-Analyzer
Using Natural Language Processing in order to analyze the sentiment of stocks, essentially performing fundamental Analysis.

# Things that can Still be Optimized:
Give larger weighting to sentiment of recent news compared to past news
Small bug with web scraper where dates today are shown as datetime(today's date) instead of just today's date
Current Model not the greatest for stock sentiment analysis, try combining the weightings and stuff
