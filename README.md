# Stock-Sentiment-Analyzer
Using Natural Language Processing in order to analyze the sentiment of stocks, essentially performing fundamental Analysis.

# Things that can Still be Optimized:
Give larger weighting to sentiment of recent news compared to past news
Small bug with web scraper where dates today are shown as datetime(today's date) instead of just today's date
Current Model not the greatest for stock sentiment analysis, try combining the weightings and stuff

# Work in Progress:
1. Building more intuitive UI (hehe web dev)
2. Improving the Accuracy of the Sentiment Analyzer by optimizing weightings for different models
3. Adding features to analyze the standard deviation, correlation with market, and mean growth of a given stock over a period of time
4. Calculting financial metrics such as sharpe ratio and Alpha/Beta Values
